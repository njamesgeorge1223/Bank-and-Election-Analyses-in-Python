This folder contains the files for the PyBank challenge.  The Python script, PyBankMain.py, reads profit/loss data for one company over a single year (2023), which is in a CSV file in the Resources folder, budgetData.csv, and contains two columns: 'Date' and 'Profit/Losses'.  The Python script then takes the records and calculates each of the following values: the total number of records, the net total amount of 'Profit/Losses', the average changes in 'Profit/Losses', the greatest increase in profits (date and amount), and the greatest decrease in profits (date and amount).  In addition, the script both prints the results to the terminal and exports them to a text file in the Analysis folder, budget_data_analysis.txt.
