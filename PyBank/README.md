This folder contains the files for the PyBank challenge.  The program reads budget data from a csv file in the Resources 
folder, budget_data.csv, composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".  The Python script analyzes the records 
to calculate each of the following values: the total number of months included in the dataset, the net total amount 
of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period and the average of 
those changes, the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period, and the greatest decrease 
in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.  In addition, the program both prints the analysis to the terminal 
and exports a text file, budget_data_analysis.txt, with the results to the analysis folder.
