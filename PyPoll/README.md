This folder contains the files for the PyPoll Challenge.  This program takes poll data from a CSV file in the Resources folder, electionData.csv. The file contains three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate".  This Python script takes the votes and calculates each of the following values: the total number of votes cast, a complete list of candidates who received votes, the percentage of votes each candidate won, the total number of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on popular vote.  In addition, the program both prints the results to the terminal and exports them to a text file in the Analysis folder, electionDataAnalysis.txt.
