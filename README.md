# Python Challenges

## PyBank

For this Challenge, I created a Python script to analyze a company's financial records from a csv file, budget_data.csv.  The script calculated each of the following values:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset: 86

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period: $22,564,198

  * The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes: (-8,311.11 USD)

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period: August 16, 2023 (1,862,002.00 USD)

  * The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period: February 14, 2023 (-1,825,558.00 USD)


## PyPoll

For this Challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process; the associated poll data was in an input csv file, election_data.csv.  The Python script analyzes the votes in the dataset and calculates each of the following values:

  * The total number of votes cast: 369,711

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes:

    Charles Casper Stockham

    Diana DeGette

    Raymon Anthony Doane

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won:

    Charles Casper Stockham: 23.05%

    Diana DeGette: 73.81%

    Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.14%

  * The total number of votes each candidate won:

    Charles Casper Stockham: 85,213

    Diana DeGette: 272,892

    Raymon Anthony Doane: 11,606

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote: Diana DeGette

Both programs are versatile and capable of processing other data sets with the same formats: for instance, PyPoll can also handle write-in candidates and announce ties.
