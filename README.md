# Python Challenge

## PyBank

For this Challenge, I created a Python script to analyze the financial records 
of a company located in a csv file, budget_data.csv.  The script calculated
each of the following values:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


## PyPoll

For this Challenge, I was given a set of poll data called election_data.csv and
tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.  
The Python script analyzes the votes in the dataset and calculates each of the
following values:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote
